Doom Emacs Private Config

My personal Doom Emacs private config. It's primarily used for Org-Roam as Second Brain style notetaking.

Things added from Vanilla
- Doom Gruvbox theme
- Simpleclip to allow for traditional CMD-c CMD-v cut/paste (CUA type customizations)
- Deft parse files for Deft file navigation
- Org Roam and Org Roam UI
- Org-yt package for in-block embedded youtube videos and images
- Doom spalsh screen changed to Emacs E

In general, I prefer Vim-like hotkeys since they are carpal-tunnel friendly
